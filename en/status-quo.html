            Unequal distribution of high school education resources in China has never been an unfamiliar topic, as its grave seriousness and broad magnitude have been continuously causing a series of social issues.
          </p>
          <p class=" text-justify">
            Though solutions have been taken by the government through out the past few decades, the problem still remains largely unsolved. As introduced in our front page, the reason we creates the Glowing is not limited in materialising our own idea but also to raise public awareness of the issue, as we do believe that it is only when the government and the society are acting together that a problem can be properly tackled. It also needs to be clarified that the information presented in this page will be continuously updating, as we are about to initiate a year-long research project around the problem. More exclusive details will then be revealed.
          </p>

          <!-- First -->
          <h4 class="h4-responsive font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-3">First, the scale of the problem.</h4>

          <p class=" text-justify">
            As one of the growing world superpower, China has one of the lowest amounts of labour workers that have received high school education among a range of developing country.
          </p>
          <p class=" text-justify">
            This means that only one among four labour workers in China have ever stepped in a high school classroom.
          </p>
          <p class=" text-justify">
            A number by now is already lower than some of the other developing countries, included Brazil, South Africa, Malaysia etc.
          </p>
          <p class=" text-justify">
            A number far lower than the 80% mark reached by OECD or the 60% mark reached by the G20s.
          </p>
          <p class=" text-justify">
            Only 37% of the rural children of the right age got the chance to go to a high school in China.
          </p>
          <p class=" text-justify">
            This is accompanied by the fact that the rural population takes a majority (63%) of China’s total population.
          </p>
          <p class=" text-justify">
            It doesn’t get any better from a domestic perspective…

          <!-- Second -->
          <h4 class="h4-responsive font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-3">Second, the impact of the problem.</h4>
          <p class=" text-justify">
            First, socio-economic development,
          </p>
          <p class=" text-justify">
            High school education can be seen as one of the most decisive parts in one’s education, as it provides the student with skills and knowledge that can serve as assistance to one’s career development. To make it clear, let’s take a look at a comparison between China and Mexico. As demonstrated above, both of the countries have a relatively similar situation in term of accessibility of high school education, which makes Mexico a referable example of the future of China.
          </p>
          <p class=" text-justify">
            At the start of the 1980s, as shown below, Mexico’s high school education accessibility looks exactly identical as nowadays’ China. With just above 40% of the rural population at the right age have access to high school education. On the 1980s, socio-economic of Mexico were booming, accompanying with a seemingly increasing average income. However, the real nightmare is well behind the screen. During the next 20 years, Mexico has suffered a detrimental dive. As education fails to keep up with the blossoming economy. The economy soon collapsed into pieces, and the chances for industrial transformation is further nullified. Ironically, education above middle school turns to be the peace-breaker, as there are not enough educated labour force entering the career field. The end result is clearly not what the Chinese government is looking for in their thirteenth Five-Year Plan. As compared below:
          </p>
          <p class=" text-justify">
            With a large stake of economic growth generated by the services (46.5%), China’s economy is largely interdependent on the construction of rails and road, infrastructure and real estate, a trait we’ve also seen in Mexico during 1980s. Therefore, with a vision of industrial evolution and a target of avoiding middle-income trap, repeating the trait of Mexico is clearly not the way to go. A preferable example can be seen in the economic development of Korea from 1980s to now, as they gradually converted from a heavily agricultural and industrial oriented country to a highly.

          <p class=" text-justify pt-5">
            Standing on a turning point, we ask ourselves, is it worth the effort to alleviate urban-rural education disparity, we, the Glowing tree and the scholars specialised in the area say yes.
