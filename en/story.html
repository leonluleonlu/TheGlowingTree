                As Introduced, we are a really young team composed by a group of high school students. Though holding different moment of obligations, we all possess the same target of creating and providing chances to rural students who were longing for high school education. Though with different backgrounds and personalities, we all treats the programme like our beloved baby, something we are willing to spend a great effort on. So here is our story, hope one can find oneself within it. As again, we are dedicated not only to materialise the programme, but also to call on more of you, the general public, to pay more attention to the problem.

          <!-- Albert Story -->

          <p class="text-justify">Standing in front of 60 pairs of eyes filled with expectancy, I panicked. My team was with me but I felt completely alone in attempting to teach a class of 60 primary school children. The meeting last night made it abundantly clear that for some members in our team, college resumes were top of mind, not passion. We failed to reach a common ground. I began to understand Saint-Exupéry's expression: "All men have stars, but they are not the same things to different people.“ My reverie was interrupted by a straightforward "why are you here?", asked innocently by a 7-year-old. I would spend the next three years answering this question.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">Like the Little Prince on his quest, I was at a loss figuring out what my rose was and what it meant. But I was dissatisfied with the short term solutions to education inequality in rural Guangxi. Action speaks louder than words. I decided to tap on my relative strength in the English language to make a difference, and focus on equipping talented middle school students in rural areas with practical methods to master English. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">After two months of careful planning, we paid our first week-long visit to a school in Linjiang. I was both expectant and nervous about the reactions of the students and school teachers, and was pleasantly surprised to know our pedagogy is inspiring. Through interactive games, we learned about our students and what mattered to them, personalizing the education they received. On the day of farewell, a bigger surprise happened: Several students initiated an English corner during the daily lunch broadcast. Listening to their speeches, I heard the most fantastic sounds that empowered me to carry on my venture. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">Connecting with my students over regular visits and online chats, I got to know them as individuals--their unique characteristics, aspirations, and challenges they faced. Our backgrounds were very different, but I came to feel very strongly for some students who wanted to advance to high school, but who were prevented from doing so financially. I felt a real sense of pain and helplessness that families were confronted with decisions that meant only one child out of four could be educated; that children had to behave like adults and work to support the family. I too faced obstacles when transiting to high school, struggling with the entrance examinations but was fortunate that my family had the resources for an alternative. We cared about the same things, shared similar dreams, but our options were different. I am lucky. But my students are not. Their obstacles shouldn't merely be looked at on a case by case basis. The problem is systemic. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">“You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed." With the relationship I have "tamed" and cultivated with my students and their parents, the sentiment we have felt, and the trust we have shared, I'm obliged to do something. Without the deep-seated connections, I am no different from other naive high school students who do community work as a matter of course. The empathy rooted in our connections naturally grows a deep sense of obligation. I am motivated to develop a system that goes beyond 'teaching how to fish', and to truly revolutionise the fishing industry.  
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">An online education platform for equal access to education for students in rural China was born. It is a space where the powerless can have a voice and can seek opportunities to reach their full potentials. I'm an idealist but definitely not a daydreamer. It may be true that systems of power exist to exclude and oppress, but I believe justice and love exist too. When I see so many trying against hope and reason to believe, I know I have to carry on. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">On the first page of our website, I wrote:" We acknowledged the limitation in our capacity, but it is not a sufficient reason to stop us from trying".

          <p class="text-justify">One hundred years ago, China was a country with domestic trouble and foreign invasion. But today, the country is prosperous and the people are at peace. China is moving toward to the future at a speed that the world has never think. From the past when China was in impoverished poverty, to today’s China is illuminated by the radiance of glory, we have walked for a long way. Nowadays, our submarine named “Jiaolong” dive into the deepest sea, our spacecraft called “shenzhou” fly into the highest and the most mysterious space. Chinese faces appear in the highest academic halls in various fields. All these achievement, is the consequence of our consistent effort. Have you think about what is the cornerstone of all the achievement. Is there a person is born to know how to let the rocket fly to the sky? Is there a person is born to know how to let the submersible travel around the world? This is absolutely impossible! Anyone who has contributed to China's prosperity has been well educated or has accumulated countless knowledge. However, in today’s China, with the rapid spread of compulsory education, there are still many students who love learning and have no chance to accumulate such extensive knowledge. But in today’s China, in the age when education spread rapidly, there still enormous amount of student who crave to study don’t have the opportunity to walk in the school. I believe, because the uncountable effort that the China endeavor for the education, it is only the matter of time that everyone can have opportunity to be well educated. Before that moment advent, however, I willing to add firewood to achieve this great goal. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, more and more primary school, middle schools, and universities have risen on the land of Shenzhou. From the 20-30% literacy rate of past, to only 5% of the illiterate rate today; From when no one care about chinese university, to today, China’s famous universities are famous all over the world. We have made brilliant progress, but not enough. The imbalance in the distribution of educational resources has left many children and young people who are eager to learn but lack the opportunities. We are successful, but we still have more success waiting for us to create! The contribution that the education make for the nation and society are conspicuous. I hope that our country will be stronger and our nation will be more civilized. Glowing tree is designed to enable everyone who is interested in learning to learn, so that everyone who wants to receive a good education can do so. Maybe our goal is too ambitious compared to our ability. However, we still want to make the Glowing tree glowing, use our most insignificant efforts to make a tiny contribution to the greatest Chinese education.

        <div class="">
          <h4 class="h4-responsive font-weight-bold mt-2 mb-3 mb-lg-4 fontwe" style="font-weight: 500">Our Society, Our History, Our Responsibility</h4>

          <p class="text-justify">Paul Willis, one of the most influential sociologists in Britain, once pointed out the problem of the British education system in his book—Learning to Labour—some of the working-class kids, which are young teenagers in fact, though still ended up working-class jobs after education. However, why? Why does knowledge not spark people to progress but stick at the original point? It is the puzzle I have deep down the root.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">Although Paul Wills mainly discuss the education problem in the UK in 1970, which is an era that the capitalism society gradually becomes fixed on social class, his theory is extensively applied to all the human society regardless their system. China, as a nation that achieves spectacular accomplishment after opening-up and reform, is encountered with the same issue that Paul wills mentioned in his book, containing viscous of social hierarchies and more and more working class’s lads in school. There are more issues that Paul Wills didn’t discuss in the book but are apparent in China currently, embodying unfair distribution of education resources and extra tutoring classes in private educational institution. Those things tremendously halt public step to advance their social level.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">It’s commonly doubted that, as a student born in a middle-class family, why should one lay one’s hand to the others? As doing so can brought seemingly no advantage for one who act so. Indeed, it’s not one’s absolute duty to help others, but I do find a strong power evoking in my heart forcing me to do so. Through my past experience in village and slum, I’ve seen countless individuals lack the opportunity that can vary their way of living life (less restricted). The reason for that is not a result of lack of diligence or motivation , but rather a result of lack of adequate education resources, which consequently leads them to a generally narrow view of the world. With discontinuous education, many of their past effort turns to be futilely. Therefore, it’s to create a new path for these talented children to fulfil their dream the thing I expect to achieve through the Glowing Tree.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">China has been developing gradually into one of the world super power. This is clearly not an end product produced only by the politicians and the rich, but rather created upon the great foundation built by the working class. Without them, other social group will be perished. The entire social system will ends in collapse. Xiaoping Deng once said that the primary target of the opening-up and social reform is to grant success to a small group of people first, and then let this group prompt the rest of the majority to success. Now, the former part of plan seems to be fulfilled, and the process has achieved ever beyond the Deng’s expectation, but the later part, those people that are waiting to be prompted, given the resource and prosper, are forgotten.There is an old saying in China: to enjoy blessings and endure misfortune together. However, after enduring years of wars and poverty together, part of the people enjoys the bless, with the others treated unequally.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">Finally, the creation of this platform, in my opinion, primarily serves as a medium. and through the programme, hopefully, the inequality in education resource distribution will be resolved, and the fluidity of the social hierarchies will be enhanced. A nation that does not entitles its people a road to hope is not a nation but a hell. It’s only to provide them with hope, the entire nation could operate safely, subtly, and continuously progressing.
